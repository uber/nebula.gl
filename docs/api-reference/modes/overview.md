# Editing Modes

`EditMode`s provide a way of handling user interactions in order to manipulate GeoJSON features and geometries.

The following are the built-in `EditMode`s provided by nebula.gl:

## [ViewMode](https://github.com/uber/nebula.gl/blob/master/modules/edit-modes/src/lib/view-mode.ts)

No edits are possible, but selection is still possible.

## [ModifyMode](https://github.com/uber/nebula.gl/blob/master/modules/edit-modes/src/lib/modify-mode.ts)

User can move existing points, add intermediate points along lines, and remove points.

### Edit Context

`editContext` argument to the `onEdit` callback contains the following properties:

- `positionIndexes` (Array): An array of numbers representing the indexes of the edited position within the feature's `coordinates` array

- `position` (Array): An array containing the ground coordinates (i.e. [lng, lat]) of the edited position

## [ExtrudeMode](https://github.com/uber/nebula.gl/blob/master/modules/edit-modes/src/lib/extrude-mode.ts)

User can move edge. Click and drag from anywhere between 2 points in edge.

## [ScaleMode](https://github.com/uber/nebula.gl/blob/master/modules/edit-modes/src/lib/scale-mode.ts)

User can scale a feature about its centroid by clicking and dragging (inward or outward) the selected geometry. This mode supports multiple selections.

## [RotateMode](https://github.com/uber/nebula.gl/blob/master/modules/edit-modes/src/lib/rotate-mode.ts)

User can rotate a feature about its centroid by clicking and dragging the selected geometry. This mode supports multiple selections.

## [TranslateMode](https://github.com/uber/nebula.gl/blob/master/modules/edit-modes/src/lib/translate-mode.ts)

The user can move a feature by selecting one or more features and dragging anywhere within the screen.
_Additionally, the user can initiate snapping by clicking and dragging the selected feature's vertex handles. If the vertex handle is close enough to another feature's vertex, the two features will snap together._

## [TransformMode](https://github.com/uber/nebula.gl/blob/master/modules/edit-modes/src/lib/transform-mode.ts)

Just like the individual modes, this mode supports multiple selections and feature snapping.
