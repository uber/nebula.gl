# Upgrade Guide

## Upgrading to v1.0

**`react-map-gl-draw`**

The `react-map-gl-draw` module has been removed. 
It is no longer supported by the latest `react-map-gl`.
You will need to use `deck.gl` and `nebula.gl` with `react-map-gl`. 
All functionality is still available, it just the convenience wrappers
in `react-map-gl-draw` that are no longer availble.
